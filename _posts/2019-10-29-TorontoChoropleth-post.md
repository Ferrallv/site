# Why?

My friends and I were discussing ways to tell a story with data. I wanted to try my hand at choropleths, specifically using Bokeh and creating an interactive feature. I feel that data can create a stronger impact on the viewer when you can include them as a participant. So, I was thinking about Toronto neighbourhoods and I wondered if places like "Little Italy", "Little Portugal", or "Chinatown" had the highest population of immigrants who report their neighbourhoods namesake as their birthplace. 

# How I got here, project-wise

To see the in-depth details of my data acquisition and transformation you can see this [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/Ferrallv/TorontoChoropleth/blob/master/TorontoChoropleth.ipynb). I used data from the 2016 Canadian Census and aggregated it into the Toronto neighbourhoods. In the future I plan to add the data of the census from other years. 

To be able to share the interactive map I used Heroku to deploy my [Bokeh application](https://github.com/Ferrallv/TorontoChoropleth/tree/master/TorontoChoropleth).
